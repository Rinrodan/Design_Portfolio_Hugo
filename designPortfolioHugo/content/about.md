 Hi there! I'm a life-long learner who loves making things and solving hard problems. I'm passionate about intuitive design and enjoy figuring out the best design for my clients. 
I'm a team player who has experience working in Agile and SCRUM environments. Communication is core to an effective team, and that is a big focus of mine. I also have a background in design, specifically vector art using Illustrator and Inkscape. 

I'm currently working on my Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the University of Louisville, which has given me a strong foundation in effective communication strategies. In addition to my higher education, I've completed the Galvanize Full Stack web development Bootcamp as well as courses on Design, Marketing, and SEO from Udemy. 

My design skills include UI/UX design for creating user web apps, landing pages, and blogs. I also have experience with CAD software such as Solidworks and FreeCAD for creating 3D models as well as creating logos and icons using vector art software like Illustrator and Inkscape.

On the front-end web development side, I have experience with visual frameworks like Vanilla CSS, Tailwinds, Bootstrap as well as JavaScript frameworks like React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js. On the back-end web development side, I have experience with MongoDB, GraphQL/Apollo, PostgresQL/Knex.</p>
